Create a git commit with the staged and unstaged changes. Follow these rules strictly:
- Write a concise commit message (1 line, max 72 characters)
- Focus on WHAT changed, not WHY
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update", "remove")
- DO NOT include any attribution or co-authoring
- DO NOT add emojis or special characters
- Keep the message simple and professional
- If there are many changes, group them logically but keep the message short

After creating the commit, show git log -1 to confirm.
